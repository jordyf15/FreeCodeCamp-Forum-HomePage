# FreeCodeCamp's Forum HomePage
This is the seventh take home project in FreeCodeCamp's Coding Interview Prep where we have to create a FreeCodeCamp Forum HomePage where users can see the most recent posts in FreeCodeCamp forum including it's details. The details are the topic's title, list of users who recently posted in it, timestamp of when the topic was last active, number of replies and views of the topic.
